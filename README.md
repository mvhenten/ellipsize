# ellipsize

[![Node.js CI](https://github.com/mvhenten/ellipsize/actions/workflows/node.js.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mvhenten/ellipsize/actions/workflows/node.js.yml)

Ellipsizes a string near a word boundary.

An ellipsized text looks much better if the ellipsize was added at the end of the
last full word instead of somewhere in the middle - especially if there are very
few characters remaining.

## Examples

```javascript

    import ellipsize from "ellipsize";

    ellipsize('');
    // ''
    ellipsize(undefined);
    // ''
    ellipsize('one two three four', 8 );
    // 'one two…'
    ellipsize('one two-three four', 8 );
    // 'one two…'
    ellipsize('one two three four', 100 );
    // 'one two three four'
    ellipsize('12345678910')
    // '1234567…'
    ellipsize('abc', 0 );
    // ''

```
You may provide an alternative ellipse character, or "break points" like so:

```javascript
    import ellipsize from "ellipsize";

    ellipsize( 'one two&three four', 8, { chars: [' ', '&'], ellipse: '→' });
    // 'one two→'

```

Also you may provide a setting to `truncate` words:

```javascript
    import ellipsize from "ellipsize";

    // only ellipsize if word boundarys found
    ellipsize( '123456789ABCDEF', 8, { truncate: false });
    // '' 

    // ellipsize in the middle
    ellipsize( '1234…CDEF', 9, { truncate: "middle" });
    // '1234…CDEF' 


    // its default settings
    ellipsize( '123456789ABCDEF', 8, { truncate: true });
    // '1234567…'

```
